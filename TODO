* Better config file support.
        - Make better use of command-line options as a config file,

* Consider tmux to be a good model for window behaviour:
        - status-line (as a window list) via dzen2---but in what format?
        - Configuration:  defaults hard-coded, then overridden in config
          file.
        - linking a window (like "fixed" is now) should have separate
          geometry per workspace.
        - hooks?
        - Window/workspace actions via command-prompt (just like ratpoison).

* Tidy up internal structs
        - Don't use typedefs.
        - Create a geometry struct to hold size/position information and
          update that for operations including maximise.
        - Rather than hand-rolling linked-lists, use TAILQ/RB_TREE for
          storage/linking?  How is that handled on non-BSD systems?

* EWMH support.

* Unmanaged windows need handling.

* Key/mouse bindings need supporting via config.
        - Don't enforce XK_ prefix for key bindings.
        - What about allow a leader-key (like prefix-key in tmux) for some
          operations; perhaps specified via config file?
